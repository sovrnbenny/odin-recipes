<h2>
    Wedding Gift Spaghetti Sauce
</h2>
<p>
    This recipe was given to me as part of a wedding gift recipe collection from a very dear friend. It is rich, aromatic, flavorful and makes A LOT. So please grab the biggest pot you can find. I mean REALLY BIG. Extra sauce freezes well for future pasta dishes.
