    The Family Recipe
</h2>
<p>
    This steak marinade is a family recipe that has been developed only over the last 5 years. In this short time, it's made me famous in our close circle, but until now I've never shared it with anyone.
</p>
<p>
    Marinating a steak before cooking serves two purposes: It helps tenderize the meat and adds just the right amount of flavor. Some top-quality steaks can go without a marinade, since they're already full of meaty flavor and, with the right prep, end up juicy and tender without any help from a marinade. Budget-friendly steaks, however, benefit tremendously from marination. You'll be shocked at the difference a good marinade makes!

<h2>
    Ingredients
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>½ cup olive oil</li>
    <li>⅓ cup soy sauce</li>
    <li>⅓ cup fresh lemon juice</li>
    <li>¼ cup Worcestershire sauce</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons dried basil</li>
    <li>1 ½ tablespoons garlic powder</li> 
    <li>1 ½ tablespoons dried parsley flakes</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground white pepper</li>
</ul>
<h2>
    Steps
</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Place olive oil, soy sauce, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, basil, garlic powder, parsley, white pepper, minced garlic, and hot pepper sauce in a blender; blend on high speed until thoroughly combined, about 30 seconds.</li>
    <li>Thinner cuts, such as skirt or flanks steaks, should be marinated for 2-4 hours.</li>
    <li>Tougher cuts, such as top sirloin or sirloin tip, will benefit from marinating overnight (about 8 hours).</li>
